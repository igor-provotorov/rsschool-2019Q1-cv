I am a self-taught-front-end developer. I primarily focus on writing clean, elegant and efficient code. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git.

Looking for a job in the field of IT. While experience in this area is not. I work on my own project as part of the curriculum. Have experience in another field. Currently working in the company, but I would like to work on a new specialty in the field of IT.
